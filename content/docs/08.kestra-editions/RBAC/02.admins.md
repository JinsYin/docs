title: Admin Roles
---

Kestra doesn't have a concept of an admin user. Instead, it has two admin roles: **Instance Admin** and **Tenant Admin** which can be assigned to any User, Service Account or Group. This means that you can have multiple users with admin permissions, and you can revoke those admin permissions at any time without having to delete the user.

## Instance Admin

The Instance Admin role is not limited to any single tenant. It has full access to all resources in all tenants. You can think of this role as a super-admin role that can manage all tenants, users and resources across the instance.

::alert{type="info"}
Except for the `Instance Admin`, all Roles are always tied to one and only one [tenant ID](../03.tenants.md). We currently donâ€™t provide any cross-tenant RBAC permissions. However, when configuring permissions using our Terraform provider, you can add modules to reuse the same configuration across tenants to achieve the same effect without duplicating the configuration.
::

The **Instance Admin** is a super-admin role with the same permissions that each **Tenant Admin** has, but it also has permissions to manage tenants and tenant admins, as well as centrally govern Roles, Groups, and Users on the instance level (i.e. across all tenants).

Note that Instance Admin is not a User, but a Role. This means that there can be multiple users with that permission.

`Instance Admin` can:
- create new tenants
- remove tenants
- modify tenant settings
- assign roles to users across all tenants in the instance
- do anything in that Enterprise Edition instance: unlimited permissions to see and do everything across all tenants incl. managing users, groups, roles, flows, executions, logs, audit logs etc.

We plan to provide a Management Console that will offer an instance-level overview of existing Tenants, Roles, and Users across the Enterprise Edition installation. This view will be visible only to Instance Admins.

### Creating a user with Instance Admin Role from the UI

When signing in to Kestra Enterprise Edition for the first time, you will be asked to create a new User. This User will automatically be assigned the `Instance Admin` Role.

### Creating a user with Instance Admin Role from the CLI

To create a User with a Tenant Admin Role from the CLI, use the `--instance-admin` property with the tenant ID:

```yaml
auths users create --instance-admin --username instance.admin@kestra.io --password TopSecret42
```

## Tenant Admin

The Tenant Admin role has full access to all resources in a specific tenant. This includes managing users, service accounts, groups, roles, and their tenant-level permissions. By default, Kestra assigns the Tenant Admin Role to the user who created a tenant.

Tenant Admin can reset the password for any User, Service Account or Group. However, the Tenant Admin cannot directly change the password or email address of any User for privacy reasons. Instead, the Tenant Admin can only reset the password and send a mandatory password change request to the user.

The `Tenant Admin` cannot see all users existing in the instance for privacy reasons. That admin can invite Users (already existing in the instance) to that tenant by adding them to a Group or by assigning a Role to them. When selecting the user from the dropdown and typing the exact email address, the user will become visible and you will be able to add them to the tenant. That User or Service Account will then also be visible in the Users or or Service Accounts page for that tenant, even though it has not been originally created in that tenant.

This admin role can also create new Users or Service Accounts, modify or remove tenant-level access for existing Users or Service Accounts, and reset their passwords.

If you see an error when creating a new User or Service Account, it might be caused by a limit of your license. In that case, [reach out to us](https://kestra.io/contact-us) to validate and optionally upgrade your license.

Note that the Tenant Admin is not a User, but a Role. This means that there can be multiple users with that permission. `Tenant Admin` can do the same what **Instance Admin** can do, but only for a specific tenant.

### Creating a User with Tenant Admin Role from the UI

The easiest way to create a Tenant Admin is to create a User with the `Tenant Admin` Role from the UI. Go to **Administration -> Users**. Then, click on the **Create** button and assign the `Tenant Admin` Role to the user.

### Creating a User with Tenant Admin Role from the CLI

To create a User with a Tenant Admin Role from the CLI, use the `--tenant-admin` property with the tenant ID (here `prod`):

```yaml
auths users create --tenant-admin prod --username prod.admin@kestra.io --password TopSecret42
```
