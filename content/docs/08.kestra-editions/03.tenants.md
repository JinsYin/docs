title: Tenants
---

A tenant represents an **isolated environment within a single Kestra instance**. Each tenant functions as a separate entity with its own resources, such as flows, triggers, or executions. Multi-tenancy enables different teams, projects, or customers to operate independently within the same Kestra instance, ensuring data privacy, security along with separation of resources between business units, teams, or customers. For example, you can have a `dev` tenant for development, a `staging` tenant for testing, and a `prod` tenant for production.

You can think of multi-tenancy as running multiple virtual instances in a single physical instance of [Kestra Cloud](02.cloud.md) or [Kestra Enterprise](01.enterprise.md) Edition.
::

When multi-tenancy is enabled, all resources (such as flows, triggers, executions, [RBAC](RBAC/index.md), and more) are isolated by the tenant. This means that you can have a flow with the same identifier and the same namespace in multiple tenants at the same time.

Data stored inside the internal storage are also isolated by tenants.

Multi-tenancy functionality is not visible to end-users from the UI except for the tenant selection dropdown menu. That dropdown menu lists all tenants a user has access to, allowing to switch between tenants easily. Each UI page also includes the tenant ID in the URL e.g. `https://demo.kestra.io/ui/yourTenantId/executions/namespace/flow/executionId`.

The API URLs also include the tenant identifier. For example, the URL of the API operation to list flows of the `marketing` namespace is `/api/v1/flows/marketing` when multi-tenancy is not enabled. Once you enable multi-tenancy and create a tenant `prod`, this URL becomes `/api/v1/prod/flows/marketing`. You can check the [API Guide](../12.api-guide/api-ee-guide.md) for more information.

Tenants must be created upfront, and a user needs to be granted access to use a specific tenant.


## Key Benefits of Multi-Tenancy

1. **Environment Management**: you can manage multiple environments (development, staging, production) within a single Kestra instance.
2. **Data Isolation**: each tenant's data, configuration and code are isolated and inaccessible to others.
3. **Resource Isolation**: each tenant's resources are isolated from other tenants â€” incl. flows, triggers, executions, logs, audit logs, secrets, etc.
4. **Simple Configuration**: you can easily create new tenants giving you instantly a fresh, fully-isolated workspace accessible from your existing Kestra instance.
5. **Intuitive UI Navigation**: the UI provides a dropdown and tenant identifiers included in the URL to make switching between tenants seamless.

## Creating and Managing Tenants

Tenants in Kestra can be managed in various ways:

- **UI**: Tenants can be created and managed directly through Kestra's user interface.
- **CLI Command**: Kestra provides CLI commands for tenant management.
- **API Call**: Tenants can be managed programmatically via Kestra's API.
- **Terraform Provider**: tenants can be managed via infrastructure as code.

Administrators creating a tenant automatically gain administrative rights for that tenant.

## Multi-Tenancy Configuration

Add the following configuration to enable multi-tenancy in the [Enterprise Edition](01.enterprise.md)]:

```yaml
kestra:
  ee:
    tenants:
      enabled: true
```

## Default Tenant

When enabling multi-tenancy, you can also decide whether to enable the default tenant or not. Default tenant is a tenant without an identifier (aka the null tenant). It exists for backward compatibility when multi-tenancy is enabled in an existing Kestra instance. If you disable the default tenant in a Kestra instance that already has flows and executions, you will no longer be able to access them.

When multi-tenancy is enabled in a new Kestra instance, **it's recommended to disable the default tenant** so that all tenants will have an identifier. This way, all tenants are explicitly defined and can be referenced by their ID.

Here is how to enable multi-tenancy and disable the default tenant (best practice):

```yaml
kestra:
  ee:
    tenants:
      enabled: true
      default-tenant: false
```


::alert{type="info"}
Note that in [Kestra Cloud](02.cloud.md), multi-tenancy is automatically enabled and the default tenant is disabled.
::

Once multi-tenancy is enabled, you can create one or more tenants e.g. from the UI, CLI, Terraform or API. Then, you can assign user roles and permissions within each tenant.
