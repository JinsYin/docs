title: ⚡ Enterprise Edition
---

The Enterprise Edition is a highly-available and fault-tolerant self-hosted version of Kestra, with plenty of additional features for enterprise use cases.

It's meant for production workloads with high security and compliance requirements.

---

## Key Features

Kestra Enterprise is built on top of the Open-Source Edition. However, it has a different architecture, with a few key differences:

- **High Availability**: Kestra Enterprise is designed to be highly-available and fault-tolerant. It uses a **Kafka** cluster as a backend for event-driven orchestration, and **Elasticsearch** for storing logs and metrics. This does not only improve performance, but also ensures that there is no single point of failure, and that the system can scale to handle large workloads.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Kestra Enterprise supports multi-tenancy, allowing you to create separate environments for different teams or projects. Each tenant is completely isolated from the others, and can be configured with its own access control policies.
- **Enterprise Security**: Kestra Enterprise supports Single Sign-On (SSO) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to integrate with your existing identity provider and manage user access to workflows and resources.
- **Enterprise Features**: Kestra Enterprise comes with additional enterprise features, including among others Secrets Management, Audit Logs, Worker Groups, Organization Blueprints, Namespace-level Secrets, Variables and Task Defaults management.
- **Enterprise Integrations**: Kestra Enterprise integrates with enterprise-grade secret management solutions, such as AWS Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, Elasticsearch, Google Secret Manager, and Vault.
- **Enterprise Support**: Kestra Enterprise comes with guaranteed SLAs and priority support.
- **Enterprise Onboarding**: Kestra Enterprise comes with onboarding and training for your team, to help you get started quickly.

## RBAC

Kestra Enterprise supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to manage user access to workflows and resources.

---

## Roles

A Role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users and groups. A Role can be granted one or more permissions, which are defined by a combination of a permission (e.g. `FLOW`) and an action (e.g. `CREATE`).

A Role can be limited to a specific namespace, or can be granted access to all namespaces. When a Role is tied to a namespace, it also automatically grants permission to all child namespaces. For example, a Role attached to `prod` namespace will automatically inherit access to `prod.engineering` namespace.

In short, Roles encapsulate permission boundaries that can be attached to users and groups across tenants and namespaces.

---

### Permissions

A Permission is a resource that can be accessed by a user or group. The following permissions are currently supported:

- FLOW
- BLUEPRINT
- TEMPLATE
- NAMESPACE
- EXECUTION
- USER
- GROUP
- ROLE
- BINDING
- AUDITLOG
- SECRET
- IMPERSONATE
- SETTING
- WORKER
- TENANT

---

### Actions

An Action is a specific operation that can be performed on a permission. The currently supported actions are:

- CREATE
- READ
- UPDATE
- DELETE

---

## Roles currently supported

Kestra currently supports the following roles by default:
- **Instance Admin**: This role has full access to all resources in all tenants.
- **Tenant Admin**: This role has full access to all resources in a specific tenant.

However, you can create additional roles with custom permissions.

---

### Instance Admin

The Instance Admin role is not limited to any single tenant. It has full access to all resources in all tenants. You can think of this role as a super-admin role that can manage all tenants, users and resources across the instance.

::alert{type="info"}
Except for the `Instance Admin`, all Roles are always tied to one and only one tenant ID. We currently don’t provide any cross-tenant RBAC permissions. However, when configuring permissions using our Terraform provider, you can add modules to reuse the same configuration across tenants if needed.
::


The **Instance Admin** is a super-admin role with the same permissions that each **Tenant Admin** has, but it also has permissions to manage tenants and tenant admins, as well as enforce tenant-level rules e.g. to centrally govern Roles, Groups, and Users on the instance level.

Note that Instance Admin is not a User, but a Role. This means that there can be multiple users with that permission. `Instance Admin` can:
- create new tenants
- remove tenants
- modify tenant settings
- assign roles to users across all tenants in the instance
- do anything in that Enterprise Edition instance: unlimited permissions to see and do everything across all tenants incl. managing users, groups, roles, flows, executions, logs, audit logs etc.

We plan to provide a Management Console that will offer an instance-level overview of existing Tenants, Roles, and Users across the Enterprise Edition installation. This view will be visible only to Instance Admins.

---

### Tenant Admin

The Tenant Admin role has full access to all resources in a specific tenant. This includes managing users, service accounts, groups, roles, and their tenant-level permissions.

`Tenant Admin` can `reset the password` for any User, Service Account or Group, or reset them in a bulk action. However, the Tenant Admin cannot directly change the password or email address of any User for privacy reasons. Instead, the Tenant Admin can only reset the password and send a mandatory password change request to the user.

The `Tenant Admin` cannot see all users existing in the instance for privacy reasons. However, that admin can invite Users already existing in the instance to that tenant by adding them to a Group or by assigning a Role to them. When selecting the user from the dropdown and typing the exact email address, the user will become visible and you will be able to add them to the tenant. That User or Service Account will then also be visible in the Users or or Service Accounts page for that tenant, even though it has not been originally created in that tenant.

This admin role can also create new Users or Service Accounts, modify or remove tenant-level access for existing Users or Service Accounts, and reset their passwords.

::alert{type="info"}
**TECHNICAL DETAIL:** How does Kestra ensure that only Users who have access to that tenant are visible on the tenant level? In the view for a specific tenant, we filter the list of Users or Service Accounts to only show users who have access to that tenant by doing a join on the `tenant_access` table and filtering by tenant ID. That view will is visible to all Tenant Admins.
::

If you see an error when creating a new User or Service Account, it might be caused by a limit of your license. In that case, [reach out to us](https://kestra.io/contact-us) to validate and optionally upgrade your license.

Note that the Tenant Admin is not a User, but a Role. This means that there can be multiple users with that permission. `Tenant Admin` can do the same what **Instance Admin** can do, but only for a specific tenant.

To create a User with a Tenant Admin Role, use the `--tenant-admin` property with the tenant ID:

```yaml
auths users create --tenant-admin prod --username demo --password demo
```

By default, Kestra assigns the Tenant Admin Role to the user who created a tenant. This includes the default tenant as well. This means there are currently dedicated Admin roles for each tenant, incl. the default tenant.

## Users, Groups and Service Accounts

`Users` and `Service Accounts` are two different types of users that can access Kestra. A `User` represents a **person** who can access Kestra, while a `Service Account` represents an **application** that can access Kestra.

Both `Users` and `Service Accounts` can be assigned one or more `Roles` directly, which define what resources they can access. `Users` and `Service Accounts` can also be attached to `Groups`, which can be assigned one or more `Roles` as well. Groups are especially useful to provide the same permissions to multiple users or service accounts at once by assigning a single Role to a Group.

---

### Groups

Each `Group` is a collection of zero, one or more `Users` or `Service Accounts`.
- Each `User` can be assigned to zero, one or more `Groups`.
- Each `Service Account` can also be assigned to zero, one or more `Groups`.

Technically speaking, Groups don't have Users or Service Accounts. Instead, Users or Service Accounts can be _attached_ to Groups. As soon as a User (or a Service Account) gets attached to a Group, you’ll see them listed in the `Members` UI tab. You can attach Users or Service Accounts from the Group page, or you can attach a Group to a given Users or Service Accounts from the Users or Service Accounts pages — both options are equivalent.

**What happens if you delete a Group?** The assignment of User to Group will be deleted as well, but the user will still exist as User is always independent of a Group. Group acts as a label of users from the same “family”.

**How to attach permissions to a User or Group?** You need to create a Role first. Then you can attach that Role to a User or Group. You can also attach a Role to a User or Group and limit that Role to one or more namespaces.

**How many Roles can a User or Group have?** A User or Group can have zero, one or more Roles attached, giving specific permissions, optionally tied to one or more namespaces.

---

### Users

A User represents a **person** who can access Kestra. Each user might optionally have personal information attached to it. A User can be assigned one or more Roles, which define what resources the User can access. `User` can be a developer writing flows, operator running flows, viewer only viewing execution states or run artifacts such as outputs and their preview — the Permissions and Actions determine what the user can do.

Note that Users and Groups don’t belong to namespaces, but their Roles can be limited to specific namespaces via Bindings. The image below shows the relationship between Users, Groups, Roles, and Bindings.

![bindings](/docs/bindings.png)

A `User` without a `Tenant Admin` or `Instance Admin` Role will not see the Administration view listing all Users, Groups, Service Accounts, Roles, and Bindings. They can change their own password, and adjust other settings like theme, editor preferences, timezone, and a default namespace per tenant. The profiles bound to a tenant allow each user to save their preference per tenant allowing configuring search and default namespace preference per environment.

If the user forgot their password, they can reset it by clicking on the `Forgot Password` button on the login screen. This will send an email with a secure link to change the password. The user can also change their password from their Settings page.

---

### Reset password

Neither Instance nor Tenant Admin can change a user's password arbitrarily. However, both Admins can issue a mandatory `change password request` which will send an email to the User or a Group of users with a secure link to change the password. This is needed for security reasons for those use cases:

1. Security breach - specific passwords must be reset
2. Password rotation policy - e.g. a compliance policy requires all passwords to be rotated every 90 days
3. Employee departure or customer churn - the admin can immediately reset their password and keep the user account to keep the audit logs, or delete the user account later.

---

### Service Accounts

A Service Account represents an **application** that can access Kestra. It is not tied to a specific person, and does not have personal information (such as first name, last name or email) attached to it. Instead, it only has an ID, an OAuth token and an optional expiration date for that token. The token is automatically generated by Kestra. The Service Account can be granted Roles with fine-grained Permissions bound to one or more specific namespace(s).

A Service Account can be attached to groups e.g. a group “Bots” that centrally governs programmatic access for CI/CD across multiple projects with just one Role. This is useful to manage programmatic access used by Terraform, GitHub Action, or other external applications, in one place by attaching a single Role to that Group.

Speaking of CI/CD, note that currently Kestra supports authenticating with both basic auth username and password, as well as with a token:

1. Use the `--token=mytoken` CLI property to allow authenticating with a service account token, e.g.: `./kestra namespace files update prod scripts . --server=https://demo.kestra.io --token yourtoken`.
2. Use the `--user user_email:password` flag to the CLI to allow authenticating with a Basic Authentication access, e.g.: `./kestra namespace files update prod scripts . --server=https://demo.kestra.io --user=rick.astely@kestra.io:superStrongPassword42`.

## FAQ

### Why service account is not just one type of User?

Service Account is a concept that resembles a Role more than a User. It’s a collection of permissions and an OAuth token associated with it to allow an external application (such as Terraform or GitHub Action) to assume some programmatic permissions to perform actions on behalf of a user. It’s not a real user, so it shouldn’t be a User type but an independent concept.

### Why Instance Admin or Tenant Admin are Roles rather than users?

Becuase they can be assumed by multiple users or groups, and because some user may initially be a “normal” user and be promoted to be granted a higher permission; in the same way, some user may initially be an Admin but then this user may lose access - imagine a DevOps/SysAdmin who leaves a company or changes department.
