title: Tenants
---

A tenant represents an isolated environment within a single Kestra instance. Each tenant functions as a separate entity with its own resources, such as workflows, triggers, and executions. Multi-tenancy enables different teams, projects, or customers to operate independently within the same Kestra instance, ensuring data privacy and security.

## Key Benefits of Multi-Tenancy

1. **Environment Management**: you can manage multiple environments (development, staging, production) within a single Kestra instance.
2. **Data Isolation**: each tenant's data, configuration and code are isolated and inaccessible to others.
3. **Resource Isolation**: each tenant's resources are isolated from other tenants â€” incl. workflows, triggers, executions, logs, audit logs, secrets, etc.
4. **Simplified Configuration**: you can easily create new tenants giving you instantly a fresh and fully-isolated workspace accessible from your existing Kestra instance.
5. **Intuitive UI Navigation**: the UI provides a dropdown and tenant identifiers included in the URL to make switching between tenants seamless.

## Creating and Managing Tenants

Tenants in Kestra can be managed in various ways:

- **UI**: Tenants can be created and managed directly through Kestra's user interface.
- **CLI Command**: Kestra provides CLI commands for tenant management.
- **API Call**: Tenants can be managed programmatically via Kestra's API.
- **Terraform Provider**: tenants can be managed via infrastructure as code.

Administrators creating a tenant automatically gain administrative rights for that tenant.

## Multi-Tenancy Configuration

Add the following configuration to enable multi-tenancy in the [Enterprise Edition](01.enterprise.md)]:

```yaml
kestra:
  ee:
    tenants:
      enabled: true
```

In the [Kestra Cloud](02.cloud.md), multi-tenancy is automatically enabled.

Once enabled, you can create one or more tenants e.g. from the UI or CLI. Then, you can assign user roles and permissions within each tenant.

## Default Tenant

Once you enable multi-tenancy, Kestra automatically creates a default tenant (null tenant). The default tenant is also the tenant that is used when no tenant is specified in the URL.

We generally recommend using the default tenant for development and testing purposes only. For production use cases, we recommend creating dedicated tenants and assigning the appropriate roles and permissions.
