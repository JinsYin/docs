## Key Features

Kestra Enterprise is built on top of the Open-Source Edition. However, it has a different architecture, with a few key differences:

- **High Availability**: Kestra Enterprise is designed to be highly-available and fault-tolerant. It uses a **Kafka** cluster as a backend for event-driven orchestration, and **Elasticsearch** for storing logs and metrics. This does not only improve performance, but also ensures that there is no single point of failure, and that the system can scale to handle large workloads.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Kestra Enterprise supports multi-tenancy, allowing you to create separate environments for different teams or projects. Each tenant is completely isolated from the others, and can be configured with its own access control policies.
- **Enterprise Security**: Kestra Enterprise supports Single Sign-On (SSO) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to integrate with your existing identity provider and manage user access to workflows and resources.
- **Enterprise Features**: Kestra Enterprise comes with additional enterprise features, including among others Secrets Management, Audit Logs, Worker Groups, Organization Blueprints, Namespace-level Secrets, Variables and Task Defaults management.
- **Enterprise Integrations**: Kestra Enterprise integrates with enterprise-grade secret management solutions, such as AWS Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, Elasticsearch, Google Secret Manager, and Vault.
- **Enterprise Support**: Kestra Enterprise comes with guaranteed SLAs and priority support.
- **Enterprise Onboarding**: Kestra Enterprise comes with onboarding and training for your team, to help you get started quickly.
